# googledrive-as-server

This tool lets you create custom user login/register forms, image/audio/video upload and display page, and other input forms. Now the usage of this tool instead of *```google forms```* is that it can not only upload datas to google drive but also fetch datas,validation datas etc... from the google drive. Here the html file is generated which can be modified as per user's need, instead of using build in templates in *```google forms```*.
